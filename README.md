# Final Year Project
A sensor fusion system for maintaining zone 2 training and enhancing user motivation.

Research Aims:
    The aim of this project is to thoroughly research areas such as optimal zones for aerobic training, Modern sensor technologies used in exercise monitoring and the Influences of media on motivation. Additionally, the project aims to design a develop an exercise enhancement system that conducts a VT1 test to for calibration and utilises sensor fusion to monitor heart rate and cadence, thus allowing for the maintenance of zone 2 training at high volumes. Finally, to enhance motivation during training the project aims to integrate adaptive media controls. 

Research Objectives:

-	Research optimal visual and aural user feedback systems.

-	Research the motivation effects of media. 

-	Research optimal sensors that are specifically used in zone 2 studies.

-	Research methods to uniquely calibrate parameters that define whether an individual is in zone 2 or not.

Development Objectives:

-	To implement and validate a VT1 estimation test using heart rate data and the talk test.

-	To develop a system that fuses real time heart rate and cadence data from Bluetooth sensors.

-	To read and manipulate sensor data. 

-	To develop an application that provides aural and visual feedback when a user deviates from zone 2

Desired Objectives:

-	To add gamification to exercise in order to bolster user motivation

-	To pause media based on the zone the user is currently in

-	To use CV to determine when a user is in a standing or seated position.

-	To allow the user to select zone 3 target to allow them to improve their aerobic capacity and add diversity to their training.
